# Crate Structure Cleanup — TODO (Later)

Non-blocking refactor of `crates/jazz-tools/` aimed at making the crate easier to
read end-to-end. No functional change. Each phase is independently mergeable and
ordered so later work depends on earlier moves.

The motivation is captured in a runtime-first walkthrough done against `main`
at `fa52406b6`: the runtime layer itself is in good shape (a sync state machine
plus a thin tokio wrapper), but the top-level `src/` directory has become a
junk drawer, a few files have outgrown their seams, and a handful of types live
inside `RuntimeCore` that conceptually belong elsewhere.

## Goals

- Top-level `src/` only contains entry points and true cross-subsystem
  primitives.
- Each subsystem owns its own helpers, test support, and platform splits.
- `RuntimeCore` shrinks to orchestration; bookkeeping moves to dedicated types.
- No file over ~3K LOC except as a deliberate, documented exception.

## Non-goals

- No change to wire format, storage format, sync semantics, or query
  evaluation.
- No new features. Hypothetical future requirements do not justify abstractions
  introduced here.
- No tests rewritten. Tests move with their code; their assertions stay.

## Public API impact

Most phases preserve the public API of `jazz-tools` consumed by `jazz-napi`,
`jazz-wasm`, `jazz-rn`, and the TS client — either because they touch internal
code only, or because re-exports in `lib.rs` keep the existing import paths
resolving from the new module locations.

Two phases are **deliberate API breaks** coordinated with binding updates in
the same PR:

- **Phase 2 (builder collapse)** — replaces four public `ServerBuilder::with_*_storage`
  methods. Call sites in `crates/jazz-napi/src/lib.rs:1754, 1756` must be
  updated in the same PR. (Note: `jazz-napi/src/lib.rs:1585` looks similar
  but is a call on `TestingServerBuilder`, a separate builder — out of
  scope for this phase. See Phase 2 below.)
- **Phase 5 (typed subscribe)** — replaces public
  `RuntimeCore::{create_subscription, execute_subscription}`. Call sites in
  `crates/jazz-napi/src/lib.rs:941, 983`, `crates/jazz-wasm/src/runtime.rs:1588, 1612`,
  and `crates/jazz-rn/rust/src/lib.rs:713, 755` (plus the regenerated UniFFI
  C++ shim under `crates/jazz-rn/cpp/`) must be updated in the same PR.

## Phase 1 — Junk-drawer relocation

Pure mechanical moves. Each one is a single PR.

| Move                | From                  | To                                                                    |
| ------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sync clock          | `monotonic_clock.rs`  | `sync_manager/clock.rs`                                               |
| Sync tracer         | `sync_tracer.rs`      | `sync_manager/sync_tracer.rs`                                         |
| HTTP route surface  | `routes.rs`           | `server/routes.rs`                                                    |
| Native binding glue | `binding_support.rs`  | `query_manager/bindings.rs`                                           |
| Test row history    | `test_row_history.rs` | `test_support.rs` (gated `#[cfg(any(test, feature = "test-utils"))]`) |

Notes:

- `sync_tracer` is **not** moved behind a feature gate. The type is referenced
  unconditionally by production code: `RuntimeCore::sync_tracer`
  (`runtime_core.rs:327`), `RuntimeCore::set_sync_tracer`
  (`runtime_core.rs:403`), and `ServerBuilder::with_sync_tracer`
  (`server/builder.rs:86`). It's named "tracer" because tests use it as a
  recorder, but the surface is part of the production API. The move is a
  pure relocation.
- `batch_fate` **stays at the top level**. It's used by ~15 files spanning
  `runtime_core.rs`, `storage/mod.rs`, `binding_support.rs`,
  `schema_manager/manager.rs`, `sync_manager/*` — by the ≥3-subsystem rule
  below it qualifies as a primitive.
- `test_row_history` is consumed by tests in `storage/`, `sync_manager/`,
  `schema_manager/`, and `query_manager/`. A top-level `crate::test_support`
  is the most honest home; tucking it inside any one subsystem creates
  awkward cross-subsystem `crate::<subsystem>::tests::*` imports.
- `binding_support` is currently `pub mod binding_support;` in `lib.rs:2` and
  imported as `jazz_tools::binding_support::*` from all three FFI crates
  (e.g. `jazz-napi/src/lib.rs:25`, `jazz-wasm/src/runtime.rs:21, 62`,
  `jazz-rn/rust/src/lib.rs:14`). The move keeps that import path stable via
  a `pub use crate::query_manager::bindings as binding_support;` re-export in
  `lib.rs` — so binding crates see no source change.
- Every other moved module (`monotonic_clock`, `sync_tracer`, `routes`) is
  also `pub mod` in `lib.rs` today. Each one needs a matching `pub use`
  re-export in `lib.rs` so callers using `jazz_tools::sync_tracer::SyncTracer`
  (e.g. `crates/jazz-tools/tests/sync_tracer_integration.rs`) continue to
  resolve.

Top-level files that **stay** (true primitives, used by ≥3 subsystems):
`batch_fate.rs`, `commit.rs`, `digest.rs`, `identity.rs`, `metadata.rs`,
`object.rs`, `row_format.rs`, `wire_types.rs`, `catalogue.rs`, `otel.rs`.

Acceptance:

- `cargo build --all-features` and `cargo test --all-features` pass.
- `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` pass (covers napi/wasm/rn re-export paths).
- All `jazz_tools::binding_support::*` imports in the three FFI crates resolve
  unchanged. No `pub use` from `lib.rs` is renamed; only the right-hand
  side of each re-export shifts.

## Phase 2 — Builder collapse

Replace the four storage builder variants on `ServerBuilder`
(`with_persistent_storage`, `with_sqlite_storage`, `with_rocksdb_storage`,
`with_in_memory_storage` — `server/builder.rs:106, 118, 130, 137`) with a
single `.with_storage(StorageBackend)` where `StorageBackend` is an enum:

```rust
pub enum StorageBackend {
    InMemory,
    Sqlite { path: PathBuf },
    RocksDb { path: PathBuf },
    Persistent { path: PathBuf }, // current default-shape
}
```

Internal call sites are mechanical replacements:

- `commands/server.rs:37, 39`
- `server/mod.rs:359`
- `server/testing.rs:476, 480, 483, 485` (the test-builder façade — see
  below for why this stays)
- 8 calls in tests inside `routes.rs` (lines 1752, 1764, 1779, 1980, 2022,
  2064, 2106, 2170 — all `with_in_memory_storage`).
- Integration tests under `crates/jazz-tools/tests/` —
  `sqlite_storage_integration.rs` (7×), `rocksdb_storage_integration.rs`
  (7×), `history_conflict.rs` (1×), `support/mod.rs` (1×). 16 calls
  total; mechanical rewrite in the same PR.

Old methods are removed (no deprecation shim — this is prototype-stage code,
per CLAUDE.md).

**Scope clarification.** `TestingServerBuilder` (`server/testing.rs:27`) has
its own parallel `with_persistent_storage` / `with_sqlite_storage` /
`with_rocksdb_storage` (testing.rs:79, 87, 96). It's a different type —
`napi/src/lib.rs:1585`, for example, is a call on `TestingServerBuilder`,
not `ServerBuilder`. Phase 2 leaves the testing builder untouched; its
public surface is consumed by the napi `TestingServer` wrapper and changing
it would expand the FFI break unnecessarily. If a follow-up wants to apply
the same enum collapse there, that's a separate phase.

**This is a public API break.** `with_persistent_storage`,
`with_in_memory_storage`, `with_sqlite_storage`, and `with_rocksdb_storage`
are public on `ServerBuilder` (`crates/jazz-tools/src/server/builder.rs:106-140`)
and called directly by `crates/jazz-napi/src/lib.rs:1754, 1756`. The napi
crate must be updated in the same PR. WASM and RN do not currently call
these.

Acceptance:

- `cargo build --all-features` clean.
- `crates/jazz-napi/src/lib.rs:1754, 1756` updated to the new
  `with_storage(...)` API in the same PR; `pnpm build` and `pnpm test` for
  the napi package pass.
- Tests unchanged in spirit (only the call shape rewritten).

## Phase 3 — Storage trait split

`storage/mod.rs` is ~8K LOC, structured as three buckets:

- Lines 1–2621 (~2.6K): trait-adjacent types and codecs — `StorageError`,
  `RawTableHeader`, `RowLocator`, `IndexMutation`, `RawTableMutation`, the
  `cached_*` static helpers, key encoders/decoders, etc.
- Lines 2622–4751 (~2.1K): the `Storage` trait definition with default
  methods.
- Lines 4752–8040 (~3.3K): `MemoryStorage` struct + impls + tests.

Split into:

```
storage/
  mod.rs           re-exports + module docs + the ~2.6K of trait-adjacent
                   types and codecs (StorageError, RowLocator, key encoders,
                   cache statics, etc.) — these are not specific to any one
                   backend
  storage_trait.rs the Storage trait + associated types
  memory.rs        MemoryStorage impl
  sqlite.rs        (existing)
  rocksdb.rs       (existing)
  storage_core.rs  (existing)
  key_codec.rs     (existing)
  conformance.rs   (existing)
  opfs_btree/
    mod.rs
    native.rs      #[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))] body
    wasm.rs        #[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")] body
```

Naming `storage_trait.rs` rather than `trait.rs` avoids the reserved-keyword
filename. The trait-adjacent types stay in `mod.rs` because they're shared
across all backends — moving them into `storage_trait.rs` would create a
weird "trait module owns the storage error type" coupling, and moving them
into `memory.rs` is wrong since sqlite/rocksdb need them too.

Acceptance: every existing import keeps resolving via `storage::*`. The
`opfs_btree` cfg-fork now lives at module boundary, not as `#[cfg]` blocks
threaded through one file.

## Phase 4 — `RuntimeCore` decomposition

`RuntimeCore` (`runtime_core.rs:282-332`) holds 15+ fields blending
unrelated concerns. Extract three focused owners:

- **`DurabilityTracker`** — owns `ack_watchers` and `rejected_batch_ids`.
  Provides `register_watcher`, `record_ack`, `record_rejection`,
  `drain_rejected`. Used by `runtime_core/writes.rs`.
- **`SyncInbox`** — owns `parked_sync_messages`,
  `parked_sync_messages_by_server_seq`, `next_expected_server_seq`,
  `last_applied_server_seq`. Replaces dual-buffer code at
  `runtime_core/ticks.rs:622-684` with one keyed buffer
  (`Option<seq>`). Exact API to be settled during implementation, but it
  must support: parking new entries, draining ready entries with their
  metadata (notably whether each entry writes storage — see
  `runtime_core/sync.rs:49` and `runtime_core/ticks.rs:634`), and reporting
  whether further work is pending. Orchestration concerns (marking
  storage-flush state, scheduling the next tick) stay in `RuntimeCore` —
  the inbox returns enough information for the orchestrator to do them.
- **`SubscriptionRegistry`** — owns `subscriptions`, `subscription_reverse`,
  `pending_subscriptions`, `pending_one_shot_queries`, and the
  `next_subscription_handle` counter that allocates fresh handles. Pure
  extraction; the one-shot leak claim from earlier audit notes is stale —
  `PendingOneShotQuery` already stores `subscription_id`
  (`runtime_core.rs:273-274`, populated at `subscriptions.rs:396`).

Done correctly, `RuntimeCore` becomes:

```rust
pub struct RuntimeCore<S, Sch> {
    schema_manager: SchemaManager,
    storage: S,
    scheduler: Sch,
    transport: Option<TransportHandle>,
    sync_sender: Option<Box<dyn SyncSender>>,
    inbox: SyncInbox,
    durability: DurabilityTracker,
    subscriptions: SubscriptionRegistry,
    storage_write_pending_flush: bool,
    tier_label: &'static str,
    sync_tracer: Option<SyncTracer>,
    auth_failure_callback: Option<AuthFailureCallback>,
}
```

`storage_write_pending_flush` (the flag set by
`mark_storage_write_pending_flush`) stays on `RuntimeCore` rather than
moving into `DurabilityTracker`. Phase 6 reworks how it's set (via a
`WriteGuard` constructed at mutation entry points), but the orchestrator
is still the one that flushes, so the field belongs at the orchestrator
level.

The Scheduler / SyncSender trait boundaries do not move. The FFI scheduler
glue in `jazz-napi` and `jazz-wasm` continues to talk to the same traits.

Acceptance:

- Existing `runtime_core/tests.rs` passes unchanged. Behavior of
  `immediate_tick` and `batched_tick` is identical (verified by integration
  tests, not internal mocks — see CLAUDE.md TDD note).
- `runtime_core.rs` (the parent file alongside the `runtime_core/`
  directory) is folded into `runtime_core/mod.rs`. Every other subsystem
  (`query_manager`, `schema_manager`, `storage`, `sync_manager`, `server`,
  `middleware`, `row_histories`, `ws_stream`, `commands`) uses `mod.rs`;
  `runtime_core` is the lone holdout. The decomposition is the natural
  moment to align — once orchestration shrinks, folding the parent file is
  cheap.

## Phase 5 — Subscribe as typed builder

The two-phase subscribe path (`runtime_core/subscriptions.rs:173-269`)
requires the caller to call `create_subscription` followed by
`execute_subscription`. The pair is enforced by convention only.

Replace with a state-machine type:

```rust
let pending = runtime.subscribe(query); // -> PendingSubscription
let handle  = pending.execute(callback); // consumes pending
```

`PendingSubscription` is `#[must_use]` and only exposes `execute(...)`.
Forgetting to call `execute` becomes a compiler warning; calling it twice
is impossible.

**This is a public API break.** `create_subscription` and
`execute_subscription` are public on `RuntimeCore`
(`crates/jazz-tools/src/runtime_core/subscriptions.rs:179-231`) and called
from all three FFI crates: `crates/jazz-napi/src/lib.rs:941, 983`,
`crates/jazz-wasm/src/runtime.rs:1588, 1612`,
`crates/jazz-rn/rust/src/lib.rs:713, 755` (with regenerated UniFFI bindings
under `crates/jazz-rn/cpp/`).

Two viable shapes:

- **Coordinated rewrite** — change all three FFI crates in the same PR to
  use the new state-machine API. Largest blast radius but cleanest end state.
- **FFI-internal forwarding** — keep the new `subscribe(...).execute(cb)` API
  at the `RuntimeCore` level but have each FFI wrapper expose a flat
  `create_subscription` / `execute_subscription` pair internally to preserve
  its own JS/UniFFI signatures. The "no-pair-misuse" guarantee then applies
  inside `jazz-tools`; the FFI surface keeps its current shape until each
  binding's API is updated independently.

The coordinated rewrite is preferred unless the FFI breakage is judged too
costly at the time of implementation.

Acceptance: every Rust call site updated in the same PR; no
`pub fn create_subscription` / `pub fn execute_subscription` remain on
`RuntimeCore`. If the FFI-internal-forwarding shape is chosen, document
that explicitly in each binding's wrapper.

## Phase 6 — Centralize storage-flush flag

`mark_storage_write_pending_flush()` is currently called from four files:

| File                     | Calls                            |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `runtime_core/writes.rs` | 12                               |
| `runtime_core.rs`        | 5 (incl. the setter at line 427) |
| `runtime_core/ticks.rs`  | 3                                |
| `runtime_core/sync.rs`   | 1                                |

The flag is set defensively after any mutation that touches the storage
layer. Replace with a `WriteGuard` returned by mutation entry points; the
guard sets the flag on construction and releases it normally. Mutation
functions stop knowing about the flag at all.

Acceptance:

- The only direct callers of the flag setter are the helper that constructs
  a `WriteGuard` and (if still useful) `runtime_core.rs` itself for cases
  that genuinely have no guard to attach to. No direct calls remain in
  `writes.rs`, `ticks.rs`, or `sync.rs`.
- `batched_tick` flushes whenever the guard registry shows unflushed work.

## Phase 7 — `query_manager/graph.rs` split

`graph.rs` is 4.6K LOC and conflates two phases:

- **compile** — turn relation IR into `QueryGraph` nodes; pure transform
- **execute** — `QueryGraph::settle()` and friends; row I/O via closure

Split into `graph_compile.rs` and `graph_execute.rs` with `graph/mod.rs`
re-exporting. `policy_eval` logic that today lives in `policy.rs` (3.1K)
folds into the existing `graph_nodes/` per-operator files where possible;
shared evaluation primitives stay in `policy.rs` but shrink.

Acceptance: no public type renamed. The existing `realistic_phase1` and
`observer_write_path` benches (`crates/jazz-tools/benches/`) show no
regression — >5% slowdown is a blocker, <2% is noise. No graph-execution
micro-bench exists today; the realistic-phase bench is the closest
stand-in.

## Phase 8 — Remaining 3K-LOC violators

Phase 1 relocates `routes.rs` to `server/routes.rs` but does not split it.
Two top-level files still exceed the 3K-LOC goal after Phase 1; Phase 8
addresses both.

- `server/routes.rs` (3654 LOC) — splits along three seams: HTTP endpoint
  handlers + the `create_router` builder, the WebSocket lifecycle
  (`ws_handler`, `authenticate_ws_handshake`, `handle_ws_connection`,
  `ws_cleanup`, etc. — `routes.rs:1178-1675`), and parser/validator
  helpers. Target: `server/routes/{http,websocket,utils,mod}.rs`. The
  `mod.rs` re-exports `create_router` so `server::routes::create_router`
  resolves unchanged for `server/mod.rs` and `commands/server.rs`.
- `row_histories/mod.rs` (3441 LOC) — three buckets: data types
  (`BatchId` at line 25, `RowState` at line 102, `QueryRowBatch`,
  `StoredRowBatch`, `VisibleRowEntry`, error types), descriptor/codec
  builders + flat encode/decode, and the application algorithms
  (`apply_row_batch` at line 2068, `patch_row_batch_state` at line 2196).
  Target: `row_histories/{types,codecs,apply,mod}.rs`.

Watch list (no action this phase): `query_manager/policy.rs` (3181 LOC,
already shrinks under Phase 7), `schema_manager/manager.rs` (3105 LOC,
cohesive façade), `query_manager/writes.rs` (2814 LOC but most active
borderline file, ~100 commits — flag for split if it crosses ~3.5K).

Each split is mechanical and independent of the others. Acceptance: no
public type renamed; existing imports continue to resolve via
re-exports from each module's `mod.rs`. `cargo build --all-features`
and `cargo test --all-features` pass; `pnpm build` and `pnpm test`
pass.

## Out of scope (capture only)

These came up in the audit but should be separate specs if pursued:

- **`AuthConfig::default()` flipping `allow_local_first_auth` to `true`** —
  this is a behavior change, not cleanup. Today the field defaults to `false`
  via the derived `Default`, and tests and runtime paths in
  `crates/jazz-tools/src/middleware/auth.rs:1134, 1617` plus
  `crates/jazz-tools/tests/auth_test.rs:228` rely on that. If the new-app
  default should be `true`, that needs its own spec and a sweep of all
  callers that construct `AuthConfig::default()` for "no creds" scenarios.
- WASM/native callback duplication in `subscriptions.rs:79-148` — needs
  thinking about whether the `Send` bound should be at the trait or the
  call site.
- Rejected-batch notification channel — currently polled via
  `drain_rejected_batch_ids`; piggybacking on the subscription delta
  stream is appealing but is a behavioral change, not cleanup.
- `query_manager/magic_columns.rs` (47 LOC, the top-level helper, not the
  444-LOC operator file at `query_manager/graph_nodes/magic_columns.rs`) —
  possibly inline into its single caller, but trivially low value on its own.

## Invariants

- Phases 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 preserve the public API of `jazz-tools`.
  Phases 2 and 5 are deliberate API breaks; they coordinate the
  corresponding binding updates in the same PR (see _Public API impact_
  above).
- All phases preserve wire format, storage format, sync semantics.
- Tests are not rewritten; they move with their code. Per CLAUDE.md, an
  unexpectedly failing test is treated as a signal, not as something to
  edit out.
- Each phase is its own PR. Phases 1–3 are independent of one another;
  phases 4–7 build on the cleaner module layout from 1–3. Phase 8
  depends on Phase 1 for the `routes.rs` move only; the
  `row_histories/mod.rs` split is independent of every other phase.

## Testing Strategy

- Each phase relies on the existing `cargo test --all-features` and
  `pnpm test` suites. No new test files are required for the moves
  themselves.
- For Phase 4 (RuntimeCore decomposition), the existing
  `runtime_core/tests.rs` exercises `immediate_tick`/`batched_tick`
  end-to-end and is the load-bearing safety net.
- For Phase 5 (typed subscribe), removing the old API at compile time
  is the test — no path can call `create_subscription` without the
  compiler complaining.
- Per CLAUDE.md, prefer e2e checks over unit tests added during the
  refactor; do not introduce internal-helper tests for the new types
  (`DurabilityTracker`, `SyncInbox`, `SubscriptionRegistry`) unless they
  contain non-trivial pure logic worth pinning.
