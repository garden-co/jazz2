# create-jazz

## 0.0.2-alpha.1

### Patch Changes

- 206f0a9: The "Resolving dependencies" spinner now updates as each package resolves (e.g. `Resolving dependencies (2/5)`), so `npm create jazz` no longer appears frozen during that step.

## 0.0.2-alpha.0

### Patch Changes

- c5534e1: Initial release of `create-jazz` — an interactive CLI scaffolder (`npm create jazz`) with six starter templates spanning Next.js and SvelteKit across three auth modes (local-first, hybrid, BetterAuth). Resolves `workspace:*` and `catalog:` dependency references to published versions at scaffold time.
